CSC226 Final Project

Purpose of this project was a means to make a spotify profile page that would represent a more indepth social media esq application in the future that resembles a way to find people with similar interest of music to yours. 

Since this project uses an API, it requires a client ID as well as your own Spotify application.
To run this project there are a few steps needed to be taken in order to do so.

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/, sign in with your spotify account and make a new application
2. Add a callback link to be localhost:XXXX or whatever domain you are using
3. Copy the client ID as well as the redirectURL into script.js 
4. Start the website, login to authenicate your Spotify account and all your stats will be shown.


Future hopes:

I was unable to get a recommendation section working, as it required a more indepth build to this project. For one, it would need to be ran at a higher scale, with both a backend and a frontend. 

I would've also liked to add a system in which you could message other users, as the applications main purpose to find other's who share your same love for music as they do.
